# SciChat-LLM-with-PDF-Support

SciChat-LLM-with-PDF-Support is an advanced language model designed to facilitate scientific discussions by integrating support for PDF documents. This project leverages the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to provide insightful and context-aware responses to queries related to scientific literature and general questions.

## Features

- **PDF Integration**: Upload and parse PDF documents to enable the model to provide accurate and relevant information based on the content.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Generates responses that are informed by the content of the uploaded PDF documents.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the language model.
- **Advanced Query Handling**: Handles complex scientific queries and provides detailed explanations.
- **General Question Support**: Answers general questions even without uploading any PDF, making it a versatile tool for various queries.
